## [Problem 1](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem1.py)
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
## [problem 2](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/Problem2.py)
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].
## [problem 3](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem3.py)
Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.
## [problem 5](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem5.py)
An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index) which returns the node at index.
If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access to get_pointer and dereference_pointer functions that converts between nodes and memory addresses.
## [problem 6](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem6.py)
Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.
For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.
You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.
## [problem 7](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem7.py)
A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value.
Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.
For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:
   0
  / \
 1   0
    / \
   1   0
  / \
 1   1
 ## [problem 8](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem8%2Cpy)
 Input: arr[] = {3, 2, 7, 10}
Output: 13
Explanation: The subsequence is {3, 10}. This gives sum = 13.
This is the highest possible sum of a subsequence following the given criteria
Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.

For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6, and 5. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.
## [problem 9](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem9.py)
Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, and calls f after n milliseconds.

## [problem 10](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem10.py)
Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].

## [problem 11](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem11.py)
There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

1, 1, 1, 1
2, 1, 1
1, 2, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2
What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.

## [problem 12](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem12.py)
This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb".
## [problem 13](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem13.py)
This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a stream of elements too large to store in memory, pick a random element from the stream with uniform probability.
## [problem 14](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem14.py)
This problem was asked by Twitter.

You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.
You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.

## [problem 15](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem15.py)
This problem was asked by Google.

Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.

For example, given A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 and B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10, return the node with value 8.

In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.

Do this in O(M + N) time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and constant space.
## [problem 16](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem16.py)

This problem was asked by Snapchat.

Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping), find the minimum number of rooms required.

For example, given [(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)], you should return 2.

## [problem 17](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem17.py)
You are given an M by N matrix consisting of booleans that represents a board. Each True boolean represents a wall. Each False boolean represents a tile you can walk on.

Given this matrix, a start coordinate, and an end coordinate, return the minimum number of steps required to reach the end coordinate from the start. If there is no possible path, then return null. You can move up, left, down, and right. You cannot move through walls. You cannot wrap around the edges of the board.

For example, given the following board:

[[f, f, f, f],
[t, t, f, t],
[f, f, f, f],
[f, f, f, f]]
and start = (3, 0) (bottom left) and end = (0, 0) (top left), the minimum number of steps required to reach the end is 7, since we would need to go through (1, 2) because there is a wall everywhere else on the second row.


## [problem 18](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem18.py)

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return whether the brackets are balanced (well-formed).

For example, given the string "([])[]({})", you should return true.

Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false.

## [problem 19](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem19.py)
This problem was asked by Amazon.

Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A".


## [problem 20](https://github.com/krishnagoud646/Daily-coding-problem/blob/main/problem20.py)
This problem was asked by Google.

The edit distance between two strings refers to the minimum number of character insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to change one string to the other. For example, the edit distance between “kitten” and “sitting” is three: substitute the “k” for “s”, substitute the “e” for “i”, and append a “g”.

Given two strings, compute the edit distance between them.
